## Overview

This GitHub Action automates the process of identifying feature flags that
are ready for removal based on specified criteria.
It generates a report of such feature flags, which can be sent
to designated channels such as Slack.

## Usage

To use this action, you need to specify the following parameters:

- `access-token`: The access token for authentication with LaunchDarkly.
- `project-key`: The project key for accessing the LaunchDarkly project.
- `environment-key`: The environment key for the LaunchDarkly environment.
- `maintainer-teams`: The teams responsible for maintaining the feature flags.
- `threshold`: The threshold in days for considering a feature flag as ready
   for removal.
- `report-type`: The type of report to generate (e.g., 'slack' or 'default').
- `excluded-tags`: Any tags to be excluded from consideration for removal.
- `slack-webhook`: The Slack webhook for sending the report.

### Trigger

This action can be triggered on a schedule or manually.

- **Schedule:** It runs on a weekly schedule every Friday at 11:00 AM UTC.
- **Manual:** You can also trigger the action manually through
  GitHub's workflow dispatch feature.

## Example Workflow

```yaml

          project-key: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_KEY }}
          environment-key: ${{ secrets.LD_ENV }}
          maintainer-teams: 'team'

          slack-webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Notes

- Ensure that all secrets (e.g., ACCESS_TOKEN, PROJECT_KEY, LD_ENV, SLACK_WEBHOOK)
  are properly configured in your repository's secrets settings.
- This action helps streamline the process of identifying and managing outdated
  feature flags in your LaunchDarkly environment.
